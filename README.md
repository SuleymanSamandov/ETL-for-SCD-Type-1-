# ETL-for-SCD-Type-1-
ETL with Pentaho (Slowly Changing Dimension)
There are 7 different types of data changes in dimension data in the data warehouse. 
The first type is type 0. Changes are not accepted. And that's why I didn't start with it. 
SCD type 1 is the data that updates the data by changing over it.
